# Hi 👋..., I’m Karim Elgazar

Founder and AI Engineer focused on building products that solve real problems and scale fast.

I specialize in taking ideas from zero to a fully deployed AI product. My work spans computer vision, LLM systems, multilingual RAG, and production-grade cloud infrastructure. I move fast, build lean, and optimize for impact.

## 🚀 What I Build

* AI products that deliver value on day one
* Vision models optimized for real-world latency and accuracy
* Multilingual RAG systems for high-volume, domain-heavy knowledge bases
* Full-stack AI apps with clean APIs, modern frontends, and scalable infra
* Automation systems that replace manual workflows at scale

## 🏗️ Flagship Work

### **AIFatwa.site**

Independent product built end-to-end.
A multilingual AI fatwa assistant trained on 335K+ fatwas with a custom domain-specific RAG pipeline.
10K+ queries in the first week, fully engineered from data to deployment.

### **Medical Imaging Platforms**

Delivered diagnostic and QC pipelines used in real clinical workflows.
From segmentation and classification to automated reporting.

### **Geospatial AI Systems**

High-precision mapping and satellite intelligence tools for large-scale environments.
Custom detection, segmentation, and tracking models deployed in production.

### **Document AI & OCR Engines**

Arabic/English OCR systems with layout parsing and structured extraction.
Used to automate high-volume document workflows.

## ⚡ Product Approach

* Start simple, validate quickly
* Engineer for scalability early
* Strip away unnecessary complexity
* Focus on UX and reliability
* Build systems that are observable, maintainable, and fast
